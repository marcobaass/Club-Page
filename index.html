            <p>Backgammon in Berlin is the new website for everyone who plays backgammon in Berlin. Professionals and beginners, intermediates and recreational players, men and women, old and young should be equally addressed. The new site will be easily accessible, transparent and informative for everyone.</p>
            <p>The old Berlin Backgammon site will remain as a chronicle and archive. It is an extensive and sometimes surprising treasure trove of reports, photos and data from the past decade of backgammon in Berlin.</p>
            <p>The forced Corona break and the transition of the organization of the championship series from Dankwart Plattner to the current team prepare the cut, which should also be marked by the change of name. This page is now responsible for the present and future of backgammon in Berlin.</p>

            <p>Only the two players at the table are allowed to talk. The player who gave or took the cube can discuss it. The decision is made by the captain alone. These are the basic conditions for one of the most entertaining and exciting types of backgammon. Otherwise, the international backgammon rules and generally accepted etiquette apply. New guests are very welcome.</p>

            <p>Young people and beginners are the future of backgammon. That is why they are particularly welcome at all backgammon events in Berlin. Some of them can take part in the main tournament of the Berlin Cup at a reduced entry fee. We will try to provide them with a tutor. Backgammon must become younger and more female!</p>
